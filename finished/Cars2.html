		<span> 	Spark SRT05e "Gen2 car" </span>

		<p> The 2018-19 season features the all-new second generation Formula E car, which boasts significant technological advances over the previous Spark-Renault SRT 01E chassis – its 54 kWh battery and power output rising from 200 kW to 250 kW and top speed rising to around 280 km/h (174 mph). The arrival of the Gen2 car also sees an end to the series’ mid-race car-swaps.The new cars are equipped with Brembo braking systems, chosen by Spark Racing Technology as the sole supplier. The new cars are also equipped with the Halo, a T-shaped safety cage designed to protect the driver’s head in crashes, and to protect them by deflecting flying objects. Michelin remains as tyre manufacturer, supplying all-weather treaded tyres.</p>
