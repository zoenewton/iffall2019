		<h1>Truth Hurts</h1> 
		<h2>Lizzo</h2>  

		<p class="Verse1">
			<div>Why men great 'til they gotta be great?</div>
			<span>Woo</span>  
			I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch<br>
			Even when I'm crying crazy<br>
			Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me<br>
			Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me<br>
			<span>You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal</span><br>
			Help you with your career just a little<br>
			You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back<br>
			And that's the sound of me not calling you back<br></p> 

		<p class="Verse2"> 
			Why men great 'til they gotta be great?<br>
			Don't text me, tell it straight to my face<br>
			Best friend sat me down in the salon chair<br>
			Shampoo press, get you out of my hair<br>
			Fresh photos with the bomb lighting<br>
			New man on the Minnesota Vikings<br>
			<span>Truth hurts, needed something more exciting<br></span>
			<span>Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay</span></p> 
		
		<p class="Verse 3">
			You tried to break my heart?<br>
			Oh, that breaks my heart<br>
			That you thought you ever had it<br>
			No, you ain't from the start<br>
			Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch<br>
			I mean who would wanna hide this?<br>
			<span>I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick<br></span>
			I put the sing< in single<br>
			Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger<br>
			So you can tell your friend, "shoot your shot" when you see 'em<br>
			It's OK, he already in my DMs</p>
