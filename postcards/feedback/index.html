	<h1>Feedback for Damie Choe</h1> 
	<ul>The type choice is great. It evokes the feelings of a children's story book. </ul>
	<ul>The green background image has larger text than the other </ul>
	<ul>THe green background image looks a slightly lower quality than the others. That might just be because its sot printed. </ul>
	<ul>I think the style with water color and white background is the most intresting and sucessful. I dont think you need to put dashes on both sides of the author's name. </ul> 
	<ul>All in all, you did a great job!</ul>
